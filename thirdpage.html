<h1>Current Bruins Team 2024-2025</h1>
<p> The Bruins this season are not off to as well of a start as years prior, but have pleny of time to catch up with the rest of the league. Their current record is 8-8-2. David Pasternak leads the team in Goals, Points, and Assists, with 8 goals and 9 assists, giving him 17 points. The average age of the team this season is just over 27, which is relativley young.

    <h1>Season Projection</h1>
<p>The Bruins are consistantly a playoff team. In years past, they have had trouble making it out of the first or second round, but always give a good fight. This year, the Bruins added a lot more depth, and have a more well-rounded team compared to a few years prior. The Bruins should compete and make the playoffs, but it is unlikey that they go much further past that, even more so now with the slow start they have had. If the Bruins have a good second half of the year, and the top players who are supposed to record a lot of points find a rhythm, they may become more of a favorite to go further in the playoffs. Unfortunately, there are a lot of powerhouse teams around the league that are off to really impressive starts, so the Bruins will need to pick up momentum fast for any chance.</p>

    <h1>Future of the Bruins</h1>
    <p>The positive side of the Bruins future is that their core players is a younger group. 9 of the 23 rostered players are signed under contact until after the 2026-2027 season. With young players, good prospects, and first round draft picks for the next three years, the Bruins should be able to be very competitive for years to come. The only thing missing from this team at the moment is chemistry, and that will come as they play more will each other. If the Bruins were to win the Stanley Cup in the next 6 years or so, not many people would be suprised. The young core is filled with size and talent, and can help the team win.</p>
